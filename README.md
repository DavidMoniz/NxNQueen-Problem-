NxNQueen-Problem Swing Interface

JAVA IDE + SWING Components - I used Eclipse and windows builder. 
This is a Java Swing interface that implements the NxN Queens Problem using several Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The time of solving the NxNQueens problems depends on the algorithm and its random states created.

The following algorithms are:
- Hill Climbing - The art of choosing the best heuristic in the first expansion.
- Simulated Annealing - The art of implementing Hill Climbing with a decreasing probability of selecting the best heuristic or not.
- Local Beam - The art of creating N states, each with N possible ways of improving its state and in the end select the best N states.
- Genetic Algorithm - The art of creating a population of random states, ordering the best chromosomes(states), crossovering(between two states) random features of each chromosome, with probability and mutating the worst chromossomes except the elite ones, also with probability.

P.S - The Test.java is unnecessary for the implementation of the interface since its purpose was to test each algorithm individually on the console.
Any questions about the algorithm, send me a message.
