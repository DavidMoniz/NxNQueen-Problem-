# NxNQueen-Problem
JAVA IDE + SWING Components
This is a Java Swing interface that implements the NxN Queens Problem using several Artificial Inteligence algorythms.

The Swing is 

The following algorythms are:
- Hill Climbing - The art of choosing the best heuristic in the first expantion.
- Simulated Anealing - The art of implementing Hill Climbing with a decreasing probability of selecting the best heuristic or not.
- Local Beam - The art of creating N states, each with N possible ways of improving its state and in the end select the best N states.
- Genetic Algorithm - The art of creating a population of random states, ordering the best chromossomes(states), crossovering(between two states) random features of each chromossome, with probability and mutating the worst chromossomes except the elite ones, also with probability.

The Test.java is unecessary for the implementation of the interface since its purpose was to test each algorithm individually on the console.
Any questions about the algorithm, send me a message.
